ANSWERS TO QUERIES:

Q1: The first author's surname is just "Lumsdaine".  "LeFanu" is a middle name.

Q2: 18C50 (primary), 03B15, 18G55

Q3: Please just ignore this, it was a leftover note to ourselves.

CORRECTIONS:

Reference [KL12] is now about to be published; its BibTeX entry can be replaced by:

@article{klv:ssetmodel,
    author = {Kapulkin, Chris and Lumsdaine, Peter LeFanu},
    title = {The simplicial model of univalent foundations (after {V}oevodsky)},
    year = {2019},
    journal = {Journal of the European Mathematical Society},
    note = {to appear},
    eprint = {1211.2851},
}

l.265 should not be indented: a "Non-example" should be formatted in the same way as an "Example".

The alignment of the continuation line in the display following l.611 should match that of the continuation line in the display following l.599.

In the displays following l.1211 and l.1503, instead of scaling down the whole diagrams to make them fit between the margins, we suggest... ??

In l.1625, "eg:localization" should be "12.21".

In l.1357, "$\rho:$" should be "$\rho$:" -- the colon should be outside the math mode (this was our typo).

In the displays after lines 496, 501, 521, 658, 835, 858, 1211, 1212, 1254, 1255, 1303, 1307, 1354, 1357, 1494, 1503 (and possibly l379), the copyeditor added punctuation to the displayed diagrams.  We would prefer the punctuation be removed again; it is not required because the lines preceding the diagrams end in colons.  However, if house style dictates that punctuation must be included, then the punctuation marks should go *inside* the 'tikzcd' environments: at the end of the bottom-right corner entry in the cases where there is one, and in other cases probably at the end of the bottom entry in the right-most column.

In the lists on lines 415-430, 436-442, 465-474, 499-504, 1299-1307, and 1452-1467, the copyeditor changed the first word of each entry to be lowercase and changed the periods at the end of each entry to semicolons, and also in some cases changed the punctuation of the sentences preceding these lists.  These changes are all grammatically incorrect and should be reverted back, because these list items consist *individually* of *multiple sentences*.  (If there is something really unacceptable about our original versions, can you please send us the exact house style rules so that we can do the re-wording ourselves to comply?)

The analogous changes to the lists on lines 985-987 and 998-1001 are not grammatically wrong, but they are semantically wrong because mathematically the items are independent conditions being compared rather than items being joined with a connective, and should also be reverted back.  For improved clarity, we would also like to change l.984 and l.997 to say "The following conditions are equivalent" instead of "The following are equivalent".

Throughout the paper our un-numbered "itemize" lists have been changed to numbered "enumerate" lists.  Please revert these changes as well; we had specific reasons for choosing numbered or un-numbered lists in each case.
