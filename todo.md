## To decide

- (dependent) path spaces?  currently: macro `\paths[\Gamma](X)`, implemented
- how to distinguish fibrations in diagrams/inline arrows?  currently: macro `\fibto`, defined as just `\to`.
- how to write `\ap`?  Just as functorial action of `\paths` on arrows?
- font for definitions: `\emph` or `\textbf`?
- American or British spelling?

- Notation for (H)IT specifications: Coq-like, Agda-like, informal?
